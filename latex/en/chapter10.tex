It's evening. After Charles has gone to bed, Ada asks Emily to tell her a story. Emily tells the story of numbers that travel, that move backwards and forwards, that jump and add up. The story of a little girl who wonders, thinks and plays with symbols. And finally, the story of numbers that are written with letters, drawn and juggled with their signs like a big circus. And under its big tent there are many other shows: a number $i$ that turns heads, several infinities, each greater than the last, and many other things with strange names: logarithms, cosines and cube roots...
But that's another story, because now, shhh! Ada has fallen asleep. Good night, Ada!
